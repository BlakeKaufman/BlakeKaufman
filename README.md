<h2>I'm 20-years-old, and I love building things.</h2>

<h4>What am I currently working on?</h4>
<p>
I have been interested in Bitcoin for around 3 years now. I have mined Bitcoin, tweeted about Bitcoin, and used Bitcoin. But now it's time for me to use my coding skills to build a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Introducing Blitz Wallet, a fully native Bitcoin Lightning, and liquid wallet that harnesses the power of the Breez SDK, Blockstream Greenlight, Blockstream Green Development Kit, and Boltz to create an unforgettable Lightning experience.
